# ZigXag

ZigXag is an interactive tool for editing and understanding ZX calculus graphs.
It is capable of converting a graph into a circuit, and simulating the circuit in order to produce the state generated by the graph.


# Building

If you want to modify ZigXag, this is how you get the code and turn your changes into working html/javascript.

1. Have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

    `sudo add-apt-repository universe`

    `sudo apt-get update`

    `sudo apt-get install --yes git npm nodejs-legacy`

2. Clone the repository.

    `git clone https://github.com/Strilanc/ZigXag.git`

3. Install the dev dependencies.

    `cd ZigXag`

    `npm install`

4. (*Optional*) Make your changes. Run the tests.

    `npm run test-firefox`

4. (*Optional*, **HARD**) If you made changes to stim, rebuild stim's web assembly using emscripten

    In my experience, by far the hardest part of getting this to work is getting emscripten to work.
    Nothing I have done has worked consistently across machines.
    Good luck, and I'm sorry, because I'm just going to assume you can run `emcc`.

5. Build the output.

    `npm run build`

6. The output is a single html file `out/main.html`. Confirm it works by opening it with a web browser.

    `firefox out/main.html`

7. Copy `out/main.html` to wherever you want.
